# Complete_Blackjack_v1
It's a simple WPF project with MongoDB to play Blackjack. 
I tried to put my knowledge into practice with this project. You can hit, stand, double and split if it's possible. Project has a very simple register and login feature where I used MongoDB for free storage. It can remember your score and you can continue where you left off.
